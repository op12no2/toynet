# toynet
A Javascript version of Alexander Schiendorfer's blog post "A worked example of backpropagation".

https://alexander-schiendorfer.github.io/2020/02/24/a-worked-example-of-backprop.html

Download toynet.js and run with Nodejs (for example).

The code is generalised a bit so the shape of the network can be changed.

By default it runs the batching example on (A4 size) page 33.

```
[C:\projects\toynet\trunk]node toynet.js                                            
outputs after 200 epochs, see page 33
